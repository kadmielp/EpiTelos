# 2023 Year in Review

## Highs & Achievements
- **Promoted to Senior Developer:** This was a huge milestone. I worked hard for it, leading the 'Phoenix Project' to a successful launch. Proved to myself I could handle more responsibility.
- **Learned Python for Data Analysis:** Finally committed to learning a new skill. Completed a course and built a small project to analyze my personal finances. Feels empowering.
- **Ran a 10k:** Didn't break any records, but I finished it! The training was grueling but taught me a lot about discipline and pushing past mental barriers.

## Lows & Challenges
- **Project Overload & Burnout:** The Q3 was brutal. I took on too much and didn't set clear boundaries, leading to some serious burnout. I was stressed, irritable, and my health suffered. It was a stark reminder that I can't pour from an empty cup.
- **Strained Relationship with [Family Member]:** We had a big disagreement in the summer and things still feel tense. I've been avoiding addressing it, which is making it worse. Communication has been a weak point.
- **Fear of Public Speaking:** I had to present my project to leadership and I was terrified. I got through it, but my nerves almost got the best of me. It's a major area for growth. I know it's holding me back from taking on even bigger roles.

## Key Lessons Learned
1.  **Boundaries are not optional.** I need to be more proactive in managing my workload and saying 'no' when necessary. My well-being has to be the top priority.
2.  **Discomfort is the price of growth.** Whether it's running, learning a new skill, or having a difficult conversation, the things that scare me are often the things I need to do most.
3.  **Consistency beats intensity.** Small, consistent efforts (like coding a little each day or training runs) compound into significant results. I don't need to do everything at once.

## Goals for 2024
- Improve public speaking skills (maybe join Toastmasters?).
- Heal the relationship with [Family Member] by initiating an honest conversation.
- Prioritize work-life balance: No work emails after 7 PM.
